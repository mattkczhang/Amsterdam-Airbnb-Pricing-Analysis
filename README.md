## Description

Given the complexity of the Airbnb market, overpricing and underpricing are common phenomena and are hurting both the customers and the hosts. The prices are hard to be determined as they are affected by too many factors. Our goal is to develop a pricing system that helps both the customer and the hosts to set up a proper market price based on the details of the houses/apartments. We intend to figure out the features that are important for pricing analysis and the proper price range. 

The data source of the project is Inside Airbnb. We use python for data cleaning and transformation. We use python, tableau, ploty, and bokeh for exploratory data analysis. We also use balsamiq wireframes for prototype. 

The focal points of the pricing analysis are airbnb review features, location, neighborhood, property features, and amenities. We analyze the these features and their relationship with airbnb price through mainly visualization likes bar cahrt, scatterplot, map chart, bubble chart, mosaic plot, and histagram. This is because we believe that graphs are the best way to deliver information clearly and effectively. 

With the airbnb pricing model, we use balsamiq wireframes to create an UI/UX desgin to present the layout of the platform where the pricing model can be placed on. The sample is shown below.
